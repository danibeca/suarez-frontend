        time and date you viewed a page, which emails are opened, which links are clicked, and similar information. This information may 
        be used to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content. 
    </p>
    <p class="page-detail">
        Your Internet browser and mobile device may allow you to adjust your browser settings so that "do not track" requests are sent 
        to the websites you visit. Suarez respects your wishes and will not track user activity once "do not track" signals have been activated.
